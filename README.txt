Repository owner: willsmorgan, wsmorgan@asu.edu

This Repository is meant to be a guide while reading through Hadley Wickham's textbook "R for Data Science"

Wickham's online textbook can be found here:  http://r4ds.had.co.nz/
You can also purchase the book from amazon: 
	https://www.amazon.com/R-Data-Science-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1491910399/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1469550189&sr=8-1&keywords=R+for+data+science&linkCode=sl1&tag=devtools-20&linkId=6fe0069f9605cf847ed96c191f4e84dd 	


Not all the chapters in the book will be written out in this repository, only ones that I found to be especially helpful in learning R. 

Have fun!
